### Reflection
**What Went Well:**  
* Our team managed to improve time management compared to last week, and everyone contributed actively during the DFD creation process  
* Collaboration felt smoother overall, and we finished the diagrams ahead of our planned timeline  

**What Could Be Improved:**  
* We still had a few miscommunications that slowed down certain parts of the work  
* Going forward, we need to communicate more consistently and finalize our ideas together to ensure everyone stays on the same page

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Review base project requirements and make adjustments to requirements when necessary  
* Finalise assigned tasks and set up project board  
* Research more on our chosen tech stack and algorithms that will contribute to project development

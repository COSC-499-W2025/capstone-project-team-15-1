### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Our team was able to collaborate multiple times this week and everyone prioritized making time to meet in-person and remotely
* The System Architechture and UML design process was efficient and well structured due to everyones feedback and review
* We are coming to a greater shared understanding of how to implement our requirements and how exactly we want thigns to work

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Our meeting time was not always productively spent because we had to clarify a lot of the requirements we outlined last week in order to finalize our use cases. We also didn't split up the work until our second meeting so our manpower wasn't being properly ditributed for the first half of the week. Moving forward, we should be able to quickly reach a common understanding and distribute work accordingly.

### Reflection  
**What Went Well:**  
* The team’s communication remained strong, and each person contributed actively to the proposal and architecture work.  
* Reviewing the proposal as a group helped ensure consistency between the project scope, goals, and system design.  
* Creating the system architecture draft was straightforward since everyone shared a common understanding of the requirements.  
* Early planning of test cases provided clarity on how each requirement will eventually be validated.  

**What Could Be Improved:**  
* Some missing interactions in the initial use case diagram slowed things down slightly. Catching these earlier would save time.  
* Better time management during discussions would help us wrap up deliverables within the target timeframe.

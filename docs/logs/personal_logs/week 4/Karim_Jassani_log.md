### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Designing the system architecture went smoothly since we had proactive discussions about the project requirements early on, which helped align everyone’s understanding. 
* Adopting a TDD mindset and thinking about test cases early helped us uncover edge cases and be more thorough in our proposal.
* Everyone was accommodating of each other’s schedules, and we collectively dedicated over 6 hours to working on the assignment, which ensured steady progress. 


**What Could Be Improved:**
* Our collaboration was very helpful for aligning on ideas, but it took more time than expected. In future weeks, we should divide tasks more efficiently so that we can maintain collaboration while speeding up overall progress.

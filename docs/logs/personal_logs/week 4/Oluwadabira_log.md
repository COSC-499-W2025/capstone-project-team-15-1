### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Our team maintained clear communication and division of responsibilities, which helped us meet all major deliverables for the week.
* The proposal review process was collaborative and efficient, allowing us to refine our ideas and ensure clarity in the scope, tech stack, and use cases.
* Designing the system architecture went smoothly thanks to a shared understanding of the project's requirements and good use of the checklist as a guide.
* Initial test case planning was productive, and we were able to align test scenarios closely with the functional requirements.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* While mapping requirements to use cases, we realised that a few key interactions were missing from our original use case diagram. Identifying these earlier would have made the design phase more efficient.
